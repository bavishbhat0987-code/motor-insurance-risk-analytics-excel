# Motor Insurance Risk Analytics using Excel

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing motor insurance data to identify high-risk policies using Excel. 
The goal was to clean the dataset, engineer risk-related features, apply lookup-based mappings, 
and validate risk predictions against actual claim outcomes.

## Dataset
Public motor insurance dataset containing policy details, vehicle specifications, 
safety features, and claim status.

## Key Tasks Performed
- Data cleaning and standardization
- Feature engineering using IF, AND, OR logic
- Risk mapping using XLOOKUP
- Overall risk classification
- Validation of risk predictions with actual claim data

## Tools & Skills
- Microsoft Excel
- XLOOKUP / VLOOKUP
- IF, AND, OR functions
- Data Analysis
- Insurance Risk Analytics

## Key Insights
- Older vehicles and low safety features correlate with higher claim occurrence
- High-risk policies showed a higher proportion of claims compared to normal-risk policies
