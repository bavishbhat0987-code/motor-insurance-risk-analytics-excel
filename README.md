# Motor Insurance Risk Analytics using Excel

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes motor insurance data to identify high-risk policies using Microsoft Excel.  
The objective is to clean and transform raw data, engineer risk indicators, and classify policies based on risk profiles using logical rules and lookup functions.

## Problem Statement

Insurance companies need to assess policy risk levels before underwriting or renewal.  
This project demonstrates how to use Excel to:
- Clean and standardize insurance data
- Create meaningful risk scores
- Apply logical classification rules
- Validate risk predictions against actual claim outcomes

## Tools & Skills Used

- Microsoft Excel
  - IF, AND, OR logic
  - XLOOKUP / VLOOKUP
  - Data cleaning & transformation
  - Data validation
  - Pivot tables (optional)
- Data analytics concepts
- Insurance risk profiling

## Key Steps in the Project

1. Loaded and inspected raw insurance data
2. Standardized categorical fields (Yes/No)
3. Created lookup tables for risk scoring
4. Engineered features like vehicle risk and driver risk
5. Combined risk indicators for overall policy risk
6. Validated risk classification with actual claims

## Business Insights

- Older vehicles and less safe features are associated with higher claim rates
- High-risk categories show a higher proportion of claims
- Lookup tables and logic rules help automate risk scoring

## How to Use the Excel File

1. Open `excel/Insurance_Claims_Risk_Project.xlsx`
2. Start from the `Raw_Data` sheet
3. Inspect lookup tables and logic sheets
4. Use filters to explore risk outcomes and claim results
